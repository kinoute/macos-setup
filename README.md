# macOS setup for Development

Sometimes, I have to reinstall everything I need on brand new Macs or Hackintoshes. After getting tired of doing it â€“ especially tweaking macOS manually, I decided to regroup everything here.

**IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS!**

**Don't run everything blindlessly.** I reunited these scripts for my own use, a lot of commands or packages may not suit you. Please fork the project or review the files to comment things you don't want.
